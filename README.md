Within user experience (UX) research, mental models are most often represented as maps using nodes to denote concepts and qualitative markers of strength and directionality as edges between them. In applied psychology studies, such as learning psychology, mental models of complex concepts (e.g., learning to drive a car) are explored via network modeling. However, network models for UX-specific concepts like customer satisfaction is not a common modeling approach, but whose potential is worth exploring.

Considering data-driven personas tracked over 3 waves of survey data, does psychometric network analysis (PNA) reveal differences between their mental models of customer satisfaction?

**Q1:** For each survey wave, do the overall mental models differ?   
**Q2:** Within each survey wave, do the personas' mental models differ? If so, how?   
**Q3:** For each persona, do mental models differ across survey waves? If so, how?
